## Greetings :)

**This blog is for personal study purposes regarding **quantitative finance, DeFi, crypto**, and all such sorts. I have been fascinated by these fields for quite a few years with relatable academic and work experience. However, I still have much to study and hope this blogging could help me (and possibly anyone who somehow lands here) better organize the learning experience.

I did a dual bachelors, B.B.A and B.S. in Statistics at Seoul National University and currently am doing my Masters in Financial Engineering at UC Berkeley. I have an Associate of Actuaries certificate and have a published paper regarding Hyperparameter Optimization at IEEE Access. 

I love meeting and talking to people interested in the fields this blog deals with so please feel free to reach out to me anytime! I recently developed a taste for Belgian craft beer so recommendations on them would also be very welcome :)
