### BerkeleyX: Blockchain Technology

[This coures](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS198.2x+3T2019/home) provides a wide overview of many of the topics relating to and building upon the foundation of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. 

The course is divided into 6 modules: Distributed Systems & Consensus, Cryptoeconomics & Proof-of-Stake, Enterprise Blockchain, Scalability, Anonymity, A Blockchain Powered Future.

Trust Without Trust: Distributed Systems & Consensus
Blockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of computer science and distributed systems literature. We start out by providing a formal definition of distributed consensus and presenting foundational theoretical computer science topics such as the CAP Theorem and the Byzantine Generals Problem. We then explore alternative consensus mechanisms to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-work, including Proof-of-Stake, voting-based consensus algorithms, and federated consensus.

Securing Incentives: Cryptoeconomics & Proof-of-Stake
We examine the meaning and properties of cryptoeconomics as it relates to its two compositional fields: cryptography and economics. We then look at the goals of cryptoeconomics with respect to distributed systems fundamentals (liveness, safety, data availability) and the griefing factors and faults in the way of these goals.

Real-World Applications: Enterprise Blockchain
We categorize the uses of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and look at various existing enterprise-level blockchain implementations, such as JP Morgan’s Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and HyperLedger. We also explore business and industry use cases for blockchain, ICOs, and the increasing regulations surrounding blockchain.

Cryptocurrencies for the Masses: Scaling Blockchain
One major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of scalability. We define scaling first as it relates to Bitcoin as a payment method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment such as credit cards. We then consider the general blockchain scalability debate and look into some solutions categorized by vertical and horizontal, as well as layer 1 and layer 2 scaling. Topics include block size increases, Segregated Witness, payment channels, Lightning Network, sidechains, Plasma, sharding, and Cosmos.

The Fight for Privacy: Anonymity, Mixing & Altcoins
We look into the measures that governments have taken to regulate and control blockchain technology.  We examine Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, anonymity goals, and government techniques for deanonymization of entities on blockchain. Then from the user’s perspective, we also dive into privacy oriented altcoins and mixing techniques.

A Blockchain Powered Future
A summary of the entire Blockchain Fundamentals program and an exploratory look into blockchain ventures today, such as venture capitalism, ICOs, and crowdfunding. We conclude with a blockchain-based future thought experiment and explain the avenues for the student’s potential involvement.
