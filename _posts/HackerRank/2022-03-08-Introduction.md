### Starting with the Interview Preparation Kit

There are several questions up on the HackerRank website. For a quick overview, I start with their Interview Prepration Kit.

For this package, there are a total of 14 sections and 69 questions in total. You can solve them either with Python or C++. Of course, if time allows, I do indeed wish to solve for both languages but first off, I try with Python.

And yes, you can find the answers on the HackerRank website. My intention here is to jot down my thought process and keep track of what I am learning new. As a several-years Python user myself, I believe I am quite proficient in it but also acknowledge the possibility of stumbling here and there due to being a bit rusty. 

With that said, I plan to finish one section each day (4~5 questions a day, finishing it no later than 27th which is around when my Berkeley MFE program starts). Hope to make my days count.
