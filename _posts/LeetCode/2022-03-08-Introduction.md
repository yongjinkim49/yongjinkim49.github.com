### Starting with the Top Interview Questions

As with HackerRank, there are several questions on this site. And again, I have to be selective. Therefore, I choose to solve the **Top Interview Questions** section first.

This section holds 145 questions in total with varying degrees of difficulty. I would have to solve 10 questions a day to finish it in 2 weeks or so amount of time. I focus on HackerRank first but will see how it goes. I might feel a bit bored with HackerRank's questions in a week or two. 

Either way, I plan to finish this (hopefully) by no later than the first week (2nd) of April.
